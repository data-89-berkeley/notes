    "\n",
    "In the last chapter we discussed strategies for visualizing functions, in particular, distribution functions. In this chapter we'll study methods for summarizing distributions.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Where We're Going\n",
    "\n",
    "In particular, we'll focus on **expectations**. Expectations are summary numbers whose values describe different aspects of a distribution. The two most famous are the **expected value** which summarizes the center of the distribution, and is fundamental to how we measure chance, and **variance** which measures how much a distribution spreads, or, how much samples from the distribution vary. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "1. [Section 4.1](#ch4.1) will introduce **expected values** as measures of central tendency. We will:\n",
    "    - Define expected values as **weighted averages.**\n",
    "    - Contrast expected value with the **median** and **mode** of a distribution.\n",
    "    - Show how to compute the expected value of $Y = g(X)$. \n",
    "\n",
    "1. [Section 4.2](#ch4.2) will introduce a series of **properties of expectation**. These are extremely helpful since they make calculating expectations straightforward. We will:\n",
    "    - Discuss the properties of expectation.\n",
    "    - Apply the properties to compute the expectation of count variables (e.g. Binomial).\n",
    "\n",
    "1. [Section 4.2](#ch4.3) will define **variance** and **standard deviation** in terms of expectations. We will:\n",
    "    - Compare standard deviation to other measures of spread.\n",
    "    - Introduce some basic properties of standard deviation.\n",
    "    - Compare **variance** to other **moments** that summarize the shape of a distribution\n",
