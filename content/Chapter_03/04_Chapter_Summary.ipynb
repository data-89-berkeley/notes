    "1. Categorize the function by identifying some of its global properties. These constrain how it can behave, so make visualization simpler.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Recognize the function as a transformation, or combination, of familiar pieces. Breaking the function into the simplest combination of pieces you recognize is a good strategy since it exploits ideas you've already learned to convert large parts of the function into familiar mental images.\n",

    "## Global Function Properties\n",
    "\n",
    "Definitions and examples are all available in [Section 3.1](#ch3.1).\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Continuity:** A function $f$ is continuous if $\\lim_{x \\rightarrow x_*} f(x)$ is well defined for all $x_*$ and equals $f(x_*)$. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Differentiable:** A function $f$ is differentiable if $\\frac{d}{dx} f(x)$ exists for all $x$. That is, if it has a well-defined slope everywhere. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Symmetric:** A function is **even** if $f(-x) = f(x)$. A function is **odd** if $f(-x) = -f(x)$. \n",
    "    - A function is symmetric about some **axis of symmetry** if there exists an $x_*$ such that $f(-(x - x_*)) = f(x - x_*)$ or $f(-(x - x_*)) = - f(x - x_*)$. That is, if $f$ is even or odd with respect to reflections about $x_*$.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Bounded:** A function is **bounded from below** if $f(x) \\geq m$ for some $m$. A function is **bounded from above** if $f(x) \\leq M$ for some $M$. \n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Monotonic:** A function $f$ is **monotonic** if it never changes direction. \n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Convex/Concave:** A function is **convex** if it ``bends upwwards.\" It is **concave** if it \"bends downwards.\""

    "## Function Operations\n",
    "\n",
    "Definitions and examples are all available in [Section 3.2](#ch3.2).\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Linear Transformations...** \n",
    "    1. **to the Input:** These transforms are used to generalize almost every distribution family. They need to be instinctive. \n",
    "        - **Horizontal Translation:** Replace $f(x)$ with $f(x - s)$ to **translate** the function horizontally by a shift $s$. For example, $f(x - 3)$ looks like $f(x)$ shifted horizontally to the right by 3 units. \n",
    "\n",
    "        - **Dilation:** Replace $f(x)$ with $f(x/a)$ for some $a > 0$ to **dilate** the function. Using $a$ less than 1 compresses the function by making it narrower. Using $a$ greater than 1 expands the function by making it wider. You can think of $a$ as controlling a zoom factor on the horizontal axis. If $a < 0$ then the result also reflects $f$ about $x = 0$. \n",
    "    1. **to the Output:** \n",
    "        - **Vertical Translation:** Replace $f(x)$ with $f(x) + s$ to **translate** the function vertically by a shift $s$. For example, $f(x) + 2$ looks like $f(x)$ shifted vertically by 2 units.\n",
    "\n",
    "        - **Vertical Scaling:** Replace $f(x)$ with $c f(x)$ to **scale** the function. Using $c$ less than zero shrinks the function by making it shorter. Using $c > 0$ expands the function by making it taller. You can think of $c$ as controlling a zoom factor on the vertical axis. If $c < 0$ then the function reflects about the horizontal axis.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Function Combinations:** Every function studied in this class can be broken into simpler parts that are combined either by an algebraic operation or via a composition. Look for ways to break functions into recognizable parts. \n",
    "\n",
    "    1. **Algebraic Combination:** \n",
    "        - **Function Addition and Multiplication:** As they sound. $f(x) + g(x)$ or $f(x) \\times g(x)$. Visualize the first like a stacked plot where the two functions sit on top of one another. The second takes practice, and is often best left to the tools from [Sections 3.1](#ch3.1) and [Section 3.3](#ch3.3). When given a product, always check the roots and sign of each term separately. \n",
    "            - Unfortunately, many distributions are expressed as products of functions. \n",
    "        - **Linear Combination:** This is a special version of function addition. It looks like $a f(x) + b g(x)$ for some coefficient $a$ and $b$ that scale each term in the combination. Important examples in probability are mixture distributions. \n",
    "\n",
    "    1. **Function Composition:** The **composition** of $f$ and $g$ is $f \\circ g(x) = f(g(x))$. Many distributions are expressed as compositions. \n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Inverses:** If $f$ is monotonic, then its inverse, $f^{-1}$ is the function that accepts outputs of $f$ and returns the matching input.\n",
    "    - In other words, given $f(x) = y$, $f^{-1}(y) = x$. \n",
    "    - Inverse are constructed by reflecting $f$ about the $x = y$ line (exchange inputs and outputs).\n",
    "    - The most important example in probability are the exponential and logarithm functions."

    "If you can't draw a function using its global properties, or by recognizing it as a transformation/combination of functions you recognize, then you will need to evaluate it at a series of key reference points. \n",

    "1. Make a list of reference points. In rough order of work to evaluate. \n",
    "    - Any inputs where $f$ is easy to evaluate (often, $x = 0$ and $x = \\pm 1$).\n",
    "    - The smallest and largest possible inputs. If necessary, take limits. \n",
    "    - An axis of symmetry if it exists.\n",
    "    - Any roots (locations where $f(x) = 0$) or poles (locations where $f(x)$ diverges).\n",

    "    - All maxima and minima of the function.\n",
    "        - Check for places where the derivative $\\frac{d}{dx} f(x) = 0$ and the sign of the derivative in between its roots\n",
    "    - Any inflection points of the function.\n",

    "    - Evaluate $f$ at each reference.\n",
    "    - Evaluate the slope of $f$ at each reference. Check whether you know the slope before computing a derivative.\n",
    "    - Evaluate the sign of the second derivative of $f$ at each reference. Check whether you know the sign of the second derivative before computing a derivative.\n",
    "\n",
    "That's a long list, but you rarely need all of it. The more you practice, the faster you'll get at recognizing functions, and the fewer reference points you'll need. Most functions don't have all the references on this list, so you can usually skip a bunch with little effort. For many distributions it is enough to check the largest and smallest possible inputs, check for symmetry, and to identify maxima and minima. \n",
