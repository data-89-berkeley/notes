    "1. **to the Input:** These transforms are used to generalize almost every distribution family. They need to be instinctive. \n",
    "    - **Horizontal Translation:** Replace $f(x)$ with $f(x - s)$ to **translate** the function horizontally by a shift $s$. For example, $f(x - 3)$ looks like $f(x)$ shifted horizontally to the right by 3 units. \n",

    "        - Using $a$ less than 1 compresses the function by making it narrower. \n",
    "        - Using $a$ greater than 1 expands the function by making it wider. For example, setting $a = 3$ makes the function three times wider.\n",

    "It is standard practice to define a generic family of models by setting $\\text{PDF}(x) \\propto g((x - s)/a)$ for some nonnegative function $g$, shift $a$, and horizontal dilation $a$. These parameters are often called a **location** and a **scale** parameter. The location parameter controls the horizontal position of the distribution. The scale parameter controls its breadth. \n",
    "\n",
    "The $\\propto$ notation hides the normalization constant. This is useful, since the essence of a distribution is its shape, which is determined by the functional form $g$. However, when $g$ depends on some free parameters, then we should always remember that:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\text{PDF}(x) = c(s,a) g((x - s)/a) $$\n",
    "\n",
    "for some constant $c(s,a)$ that also depends on the parameters. \n",
    "\n",
    "The location parameter has no effect on the normalizing constant since it just shifts the distribution. The scale parameter does. It can make the distribution wider or narrower. Just like a rectangle, if we make a distribution twice as wide, we double its area. So, to keep the distribution normalized, we must also always make it twice as short. \n",

    "**Finding Thresholds for Statistical Tests:** It is common practice to run a statistical test by collecting some data, using it to compute a test statistic (e.g. the sample mean), then to compare the observed value of the test statistic to a threshold. Since data is almost always random, the observed test statistic is random, so we'll denote it $T$. We'll denote the threshold $t_*$. Often we pick the test statistic so that its value measures how much the observed data disagrees with what we would expect, or is typical, under some hypothesis. Usually, the larger the test statistic, the more evidence we have that the hypothsis is false. Formally, we pose a chance model for $T$ that should hold under the hypothesis. Then, we select the threshold so that, if the hypothesis were true, then $\\text{Pr}(T \\leq t_*) = 1 - \\alpha$ for some desired $\\alpha$ close to zero. That way, if we observe $T > t_*$, then the observed data would have been suspiciously atypical had our hypothesis been true. This is usually considered statistical evidence against the hypothesis. The chance, $\\text{Pr}(T > t_*)$ is the (inf)famous \"p\"-value. \n",
    "\n",
    "The level $\\alpha$ controls how conservative, and how sensitive, our test is. You can think of it as the chance that the test falsely rejects if the hypothesis is ture.  It is the level of evidence we demand in order to reject the hypothesis. \n",
    "\n",
    "We usually start by fixing an $\\alpha$ (e.g. $\\alpha = 0.05$ or $\\alpha = 0.01$), then solve for the associated threshold $t_*$. Notice that, $\\text{Pr}(T \\leq t_*) = \\text{CDF}(t_*)$. Then, our original equation was:\n",

    "1. First sample a uniform random number $U \\sim \\text{Uniform}([0,1])$. Most pseudorandom number generators due this by exploiting some of the properties of continuous random variables introduced in [Section 2.3](#ch2.3). Namely, if we draw some continuous random variable $Y$, then, no matter its PDF, if we drop the first $d$ digits of $Y$ and multiply by $10^{(d - 1)}$ then we'll get a random variable between 0 and 1 that is essentially uniform if $d$ is big enough. Continuous random variables look uniform on sufficiently small intervals. In practice, many computers look up the time when you trigger a computation, drop most of the leading digits, then use the remainder to make a uniform number.\n",
