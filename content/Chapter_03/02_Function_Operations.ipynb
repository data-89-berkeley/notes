    "A function operation is a procedure we can apply to transform or combine functions. Function operations are the essential tools that make mathematical modeling expressive. They are also the key to breaking complicated functions down into bite-sized pieces. The better you get at recognizing functions, and the richer your album of mental images, the more efficiently you will be able to break down formula into their pieces, visualize each piece, then visualize their combinations. \n",

    "1. **to the Input:** These transforms are used to generalize almost every distribution family. They need to be instinctive. \n",
    "    - **Horizontal Translation:** Replace $f(x)$ with $f(x - s)$ to **translate** the function horizontally by a shift $s$. For example, $f(x - 3)$ looks like $f(x)$ shifted horizontally to the right by 3 units. \n",

    "        - Using $a$ less than 1 compresses the function by making it narrower. \n",
    "        - Using $a$ greater than 1 expands the function by making it wider. For example, setting $a = 3$ makes the function three times wider.\n",

    "    - **Generic:** Replace $f(x)$ with $f((x - s)/a)$.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **to the Output:** We can apply the same operations to the outputs of functions. \n",
    "    - **Vertical Translation:** Replace $f(x)$ with $f(x) + h$ to **translate** the function vertically by a height $h$. For example, $f(x) + 2$ looks like $f(x)$ shifted vertically by 2 units.\n",

    "        - Using $c < 1$ shrinks the function by making it shorter.  For example, replacing $f(x)$ with $\\frac{1}{3} f(x)$ compresses $f$ vertically by a factor of 3.\n",

    "$$\\int_{x = -\\infty}^{\\infty} \\text{PDF}(x) dx = 1. $$\n",
    "\n",
    "It is standard practice to define a generic family of models by setting $\\text{PDF}(x) \\propto g((x - s)/a)$ for some nonnegative function $g$, shift $a$, and horizontal dilation $a$. These parameters are often called a **location** and a **scale** parameter. The location parameter controls the horizontal position of the distribution. The scale parameter controls its breadth. \n",
    "\n",
    "The $\\propto$ notation hides the normalization constant. This is useful, since the essence of a distribution is its shape, which is determined by the functional form $g$. However, when $g$ depends on some free parameters, then we should always remember that:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\text{PDF}(x) = c(s,a) g((x - s)/a) $$\n",
    "\n",
    "for some constant $c(s,a)$ that also depends on the parameters. \n",
    "\n",
    "The location parameter has no effect on the normalizing constant since it just shifts the distribution. The scale parameter does. It can make the distribution wider or narrower. Just like a rectangle, if we make a distribution twice as wide, we double its area. So, to keep the distribution normalized, we must also always make it twice as short. \n",
    "\n",
    "Generically:\n",

    "$$\\text{PDF}(x) = \\frac{C}{|a|} g \\left(\\frac{(x - s)}{a} \\right) $$\n",

    "        - Visualizing function products takes practice, and is often best left to the tools from [Sections 3.1](#ch3.1) and [Section 3.3](#ch3.3). When given a product, always check the roots and sign of each term separately. Unfortunately, many distributions are expressed as products of functions. \n",

Suppose that, in the first population, 1 in 5 individuals have the characteristic, and in the second, 2 of 3 do. \n",

    "2. **Function Composition:** The **composition** of $h$ and $g$ is $h \\circ g(x) = h(g(x))$. Many distributions are expressed as compositions. \n",
    "    - To visualize an arbitrary function composition, proceed as follows: \n",
    "        1. Draw the inner function, $g(x)$, and the outer function $h(x)$. Clearly distinguish them with different colors or markers so we don't mix them up. \n",
    "        1. Add to your plot the line $y = x$. This line is useful since we can use it to exchange inputs and outputs.\n",
    "        1. Work an input at a time. Pick some $x$. Add a point at $(x,0)$ on the x-axis. Trace a lightly dashed line vertically upwards so we can remember where we started.\n",
    "            - Next, add a point at $(x,g(x))$ where your dashed vertical meets $g(x)$. We've now produced the output of the inner function. \n",
    "            - To pass the output of the inner function into the input of the outer function, trace horizontally across from $(x,g(x))$ to $(g(x),g(x))$. This is the intercept between the horizontal line passing through $(x,g(x))$ and the $y = x$ line. Then, trace vertically from $(g(x),g(x))$ to $(g(x),h(g(x)))$. This is the intercept of a vertical line leaving $(g(x),g(x))$ and intersecting the outer function $f$. \n",
    "            -  We've now recovered $h(g(x))$. To plot it at the correct input, trace horizontally until you intercept the lightly dashed line leaving the original $x$. That is, from $(g(x),h(g(x)))$ to $(x,h(g(x)))$.\n",
    "    - This process is a bit involved at first, but its a nice visual procedure. Once you get the hang of it, you can use it to very quickly evaluate compositions of arbitrary $f$ and $g$. Just repeat the process for a bunch of different $x$ values. It is good practice to try this by hand at least once. \n",
    "    \n",
    "Run the code cell below to visualize the composition of two functions. The dashed orange lines represent the procedure provided above. Try building up an example composition. A good place to start is $f(x) = e^{-\\frac{1}{2} x^2 + 1}$ where the inner function $g$ is a negated quadratic and the outer function is an exponential. You'll practice with this example in discussion.\n",
    "    - This is an example where the inner function is concave, and the outer function is both monotonic and nonnegative. This recipe *inner concave*, *outer monotonically increasing and nonnegative* is a good procedure for building density functions. The outer function ensures that the composition returns a nonnegative number. It is usually selected so that it converges to zero in the limit as its input approaches the smallest possible output of the inner function. \n",
