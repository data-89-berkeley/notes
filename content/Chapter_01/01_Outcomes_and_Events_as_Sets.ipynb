    "## Combining Events\n",

    "We will often define events as combinations of other events. For instance, we might be interested in the event that a randomly sampled student is either a sophomore or junior. This event concatenates the events, the student is a sophomore, and the event, the student is a junior. Formally, we combine events by listing the constraints that define each component of the event, then rules for combining those constraints. These rules can be boiled down to four logical operations:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **not:** e.g. event $A$ does *not* happen. Applying \"not\" replaces $A$ with its complement, $A^c$.\n",
    "    - So, every time you see (or think) the word **not** you should consider the event's **complement**.\n",
    "\n",
    "    ![A complement.](Complement.png \"A compelement.\")   \n",
    "\n",
    "1. **or:** e.g. either event $A$ happens *or* event $B$ happens. Applying \"or\" combines all the outcomes contained in the collections $E$ and $F$. \n",
    "    - For instance, the set of die rolls that are either even *or* less than 4 is the set $\\{2,4,6,1,3\\}$. Notice that we never list an identical outcome twice. This set is produced by listing all the distinct entries that appear in $\\{2,4,6\\}$ *or* $\\{1,2,3\\}$. \n",
    "    - The set operation that corresponds to **or** is a **union**, denoted $\\cup$. For instance, if $A = \\{2,4,6\\}$ and $B = \\{1,2,3\\}$ then $A \\cup B = \\{1,2,3,4,6\\}$. You should read $A \\cup B$ as \"$A$ union $B$\". Like in a good marriage, the union of two sets is the collection of all entries owned by both sets.\n",
    "    - Notice: combining sets with the contraction \"or\" never makes the sets smaller. If they are distinct, it makes the sets larger. So, adding an \"or\" statement makes an event more general. The more ways an event can occur, the more likely it is. So, expanding an event with an \"or\" statements never decreases its chance.\n",
    "\n",
    "    ![A union B.](Union.png \"A union B.\") \n",
    "\n",
    "1. **and:** e.g. event $A$ happens *and* event $B$ happens. Applying \"and\" restricts our attention to only the outcomes that are contained in both sets. These are the outcomes that satisfy all of the conditions in $A$ and $B$. For instance, the set of all die rolls that are even *and* are less than 4 is the set $\\{2\\}$.\n",
    "    - The set operation that corresponds to **and** is a **intersection**, denoted $\\cap$. For instance, if $A = \\{2,4,6\\}$ and $B = \\{1,2,3\\}$ then $A \\cap B = \\{2\\}$. You should read $A \\cap B$ as \"$A$ intersect $B$\".\n",
    "    - Notice: combining sets with the contraction \"and\" never makes the sets larger. It usually makes the sets smaller. So, adding an \"and\" statement makes an event more specific. Contracting an event with an \"and\" statements never increases its chance.\n",

    "1. **if:** e.g. what is the probability that event $A$ happens *if* event $B$ happens? Applying *if* restricts the outcome space. If $B$ happens, then any outcome $\\omega \\notin F$ cannot happen. So, since we don't need to consider impossible events when computing chances, we can replace $\\Omega$ with $B$.\n",
    "    - Restricting the outcome space to all outcomes that satisfy an *if* statement is called **conditioning**. \n",
    "    - For instance, the probability that a die roll is less than 4 *if the roll is even* should be computed using the outcome space $\\{2,4,6\\}$. \n",
    "    - It is common to use \"given that\" instead of \"if\". For instance, the statements, \"Find the probability that a die roll is less than 4 if it is even\" is the same as the statement \"Find the probability that a die roll is less than 4 given that the roll is even.\"\n",

    "## P.S. A Comment on Notation\n",
    "\n",
    "We introduced a lot of notation in this section. Notation is crucial in mathematics since abstract notation can express a general idea that is realized in many different specific ways. For instance, $\\text{Pr}(E)$ means the probability of the event $E$, which can serve as shorthand for any of the probabilities listed at the start of the chapter. We could let $E$ stand for *\"it rains tomorrow\"* or *\"this stock doubles in value in the next quarter\"* without changing the notation used for the probability of an event. Compressing many different statements with an abstract shorthand is powerful since it will allow us to prove common facts about apparently unrelated systems. It will also allow us to say complicated things quickly.\n",
    "\n",
    "Notation is also intimidating and exclusionary. Like any language, it is foreign on first exposure, and can seem more like a special code, or pedant's jargon. We will do our best to avoid unneeded notation and to explain every notation introduced. In exchange, we promise that the notation we do use is worth learning, and expect you to learn it. \n",
    "\n",
    "If you struggle with new notation, or found the notation above opaque, be proactive, and treat it like you would a foreign language. Make a table, with symbols on one side, name each symbol, then add a plain language description of each symbol or notation. It can help to write out a long form explanation, then a concise, pithy, \"key\" that you use to express the essence of the idea. Try to make the \"key\" memorable. \n",
    "\n",
    "Many ideas in set theory are best represented visually with a Venn diagram. So, try drawing a Venn diagram for the cases $A = B$, $A \\subset B$, $B \\subset A$, and $A$ and $B$ disjoint. Make space in your table for these visuals. You'll rehearse these skills in your first discussion section."
