We'll see that, to work out the probability that $A$ and $B$ happen, it is easier to first work out the probability that $A$ happens *if* $B$ happens (or visa versa). The probability that $A$ happens if $B$ happens is a conditional probability. We call it a *conditional* probability since the statement *conditions* on some other outcome, i.e. adds an additional condition that restricts the outcome space."
