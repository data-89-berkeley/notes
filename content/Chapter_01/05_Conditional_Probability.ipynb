    "Marginals | $3/10$ | $3/10$ | $4/10$ | 1\n",
    "\n",
    "Then, when we condition on the assumption that it is cold, we are rejecting the possibility that it is warm or hot. In essence, we are *restricting our outcome space*. If it is cold, then it cannot be warm or hot, so any event in the sets \"warm\" or \"hot\" is not possible after conditioning. So, when we condition, we can, in essence, drop the bottom two rows of the table:\n",

    "So, unlike the operations \"not\", \"or\", and \"and\", which act on the definition of the event, the logical operation \"if\" acts on the space of possible outcomes, $\\Omega$. So, unlike the first three operations, which change the composition of the event, \"if\" changes the list of outcomes that could occur. As a result, *conditioning* will change both the numerator *and* the denominator when we equate probability to proportion or frequency. All other operations only act on the numerator.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Normalization\n",
    "\n",
    "Take a look at the conditioned table. All of the numbers in the table are nonnegative and less than one, so could be chances, however, they don't add to one, so fail to form a distribution. The marginal, at the far right, is $6/10$, not 1, so the list $[2/10, 3/10, 1/10]$ can't define a full distribution. \n",

    "\n",
    "So, we can get a valid distribution if we rescale the joint entries of the row by its sum. Notice that this is the same as putting all elements of the row over the least common multiple of their numerators, ignoring the denominator, then replacing it with the sum of the numerators:\n",

    "While we could normalize our list $[2/10, 3/10, 1/10]$ to make a valid categorical distribution, it is not clear that we should. Why would normalizing by the marginal correctly return the conditional probabilities?\n",
    "\n",
    "To answer this question we need a probability model that directs our calculation. Without a model, we could define conditional probabilities however we like. With a model, conditional probabilities have to behave in a sensible way.\n",
    "\n",
    "Our first probability model is probability as proportion. If all outcomes are equally likely, then the probability of ane event is the number of ways it can occur divided by the number of possible outcomes. In other words, the probability of an event is the proportion of the outcome space contained in the event. We can use this model to define conditional probability for equally likely events. \n",
    "\n",
    "Think again about what \"if\" does to our model. When we condition, we are restricting the set of possible outcomes. For instance, in the weather example, we reject all outcomes where the temperature is warm or hot. If we roll a die, and condition on an even roll, then we are rejecting all odd outcomes. \n",
    "\n",
    ":::{hint} Equally Likely Events Remain Equally Likely If Possible\n",
    "Here's a new idea, *if two outcomes are equally likely before conditioning, and are both consistent with the conditioning statement, so remain in the outcome space, they should still be equally likely after conditioning.* Let's spell that out for some examples\n",
    "\n",
    "- I roll a fair die. All outcomes $\\{1,2,3,4,5,6\\}$ are equally likely. If the die roll is even, then all outcomes $\\{2,4,6\\}$ are equally likely.\n",

    "$$\\text{Pr}(\\{2\\}|\\text{ even}) = \\frac{|\\{2\\}|}{|\\{2,4,6\\} |} = \\frac{1}{3}$$\n",
    "- The probability a fair die lands on a 2 or 4 given that the roll is even: \n",

    "$$\\text{Pr}(\\{3\\}|\\text{ even}) = \\frac{|\\emptyset|}{|\\{2,4,6\\} |} = 0$$\n",

    "\n",
    "So, *when outcomes are equally likely*, we can compute conditional probabilities by isolating all outcomes that are consistent with the conditioning statement, then matching probability to proportion in the restricted space.

    "but we don't know anything about the background outcome space $\\Omega$ that produced these joint probabilities. Moreover, trying to spell out a detailed weather model in which all microscopic outcomes are equally likely is both far too much work for this problem, and, would be impractical in almost all settings. For conditional probability to be useful, we should be able to compute it in categorical settings, without somehow expanding our outcome space. So, while the derivation provided above works for equally likely outcome models, it is too restricted to work for general applications.\n",

    "### By Conditional Frequency\n",
    "\n",
    "Thankfully, we have at hand an alternate model, probability as frequency. Recall that, the probability an event occurs should be approximated by, and equal in the long run, the frequency with which it occurs in a sequence of repeated trials. This relation should hold for any valid probability model. So, let's use it to show that the normalization approach correctly computes conditional probabilities. \n",
    "\n",
    "Consider a long weather record. Say, the weather in Berkeley over the last year. Let's try to find the conditional probability that it is cold, and rains, on some future day selected at random. We'll assume that the climate is fixed, the process that produces weather does not change (is stationary), and the process doesn't remember its past forever (e.g. the probability that it rains today given that it rained on this day a century ago is the same as the probability that it rains today). Then the probability of any event should be approximated by the frequency with which the event occurs in the weather record. \n",

The result of the test is important, since it will impact your behavior. For example, if you are sick, you might decide to stay home, or may invest in a medical intervention which is costly. \n",

    "No test is perfectly accurate. In essentially all cases a test could predict that a healthy patient is sick, or that a sick patient is healthy. Let $H$ denote the event that the recipient is healthy, $S$ the event they are sick, $N$ the event that the tests returns negative (predicts healthy), and $P$ the event that the test returns positive (predicts sick). Then, there are four possible outcomes. We can arrange them just like we did a joint probability table:\n",

Either it falsely predicts positive or falsely predicts negative. Both rates matter. False positives are costly and can be harmful to the recipient if they take actions assuming they are sick. At worst, a false positive can lead to uneccessary medical intervention. False negatives are dangerous, since the recipient may act as if they are healthy, so may risk others' health, or not take medical action that could address their condition.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is standard in test design to control the false positive rate. That is, the conditional probability that the test returns positive if the truth is negative (i.e. the patient is healthy). The smaller the false positive rate, the more significant the test result, and the more specific the procedure. The other error rate, the probability the test misses a sick patient, controls the power of the test (its ability to detect sick patients) and its sensitivity (how sensitive it is to evidence of disease).\n",

The sensitivity of mammograms is 87%, so they have a false negative rate of 0.13.\n",

This means that we must model the pateint's health as random.\n",

You don't apply the test once, you apply it many times. So, you want it to give accurate advice for most patients, e.g. *on average*. When you try to make decisions that work, *on average*, over a population, you could model the situation by imagining that the decisions are applied to a randomly selected sample of individuals. From the doctor's perspective it is quite sensible to imagine that a patient's true health status is a random quantity, since they could imagine applying the test after selecting a random sample of patients. As long as the frequency of sick individuals in their sampling model matches the actual frequencies of patients who the test is administered to, then the doctor's decision to model the process that sends her patients as random, won't lead her to make any errors when reasoning with averages.\n",

Since the mammogram is meant to filter for women with breast cancer, the population screened post mammogram should include more cases of breast cancer, so should have a higher base rate than the population of all women who take the mammogram. So, let's be conservative, and assume that the second stage test is perfect.

We asked, *what is the chance a woman is healthy if she is flagged as sick*. Notice that we've only conditioned on what we could observe, then asked a probability question about what we can't observe.\n",

    "Notice how the arrows corresponding to test decisions have moved. The arrows that move straight across are true predictions. The arrows that cross are errors. The error chances are relatively small since the test rarely makes a mistake when we condition on the patient's health status. When we ask, *what's the chance a woman flagged as sick is healthy*, we asked what percent of the positive cases come from the diagonal error arrow. \n",
