    "## Outcomes, Events, and Sets\n",

    "These results are all explained in [Section 1.1](ch1.1).\n",
    "\n",
    "1. A **random process** is some process that produces unpredictable outcomes\n",
    "    \n",
    "    - An **outcome** is a specific, distinct, result of the process\n",
    "\n",
    "    - The **outcome space**, $\\Omega$, is the set of all possible outcomes\n",
    "\n",
    "    - An **event** is any collection of outcomes. Events, $E$ are subsets of $\\Omega$.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Sets may be defined:\n",
    "\n",
    "    - **explicitly** by listing their entries. For example, $A = \\{a,b,c\\}$.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    - **implicitly** by defining rules that the entries all must satisfy, and that, if satisfied, ensure membership in the set. For example, $A = \\{\\text{all letters before } d \\text{ in the alphabet} \\}.$\n",
    "\n",
    "    - The **size** of a set, $A$, is denoted $|A|$. If a set is finite, then its size is the number of entries in the set.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Logic and set operations\n",
    "\n",
    "    - Sets can be defined by combining a collection of rules into logical sentences. For instance, $S = \\{\\text{all letters before} d \\text{ or  after } w\\} = \\{a,b,c,y,z\\}$\n",
    "\n",
    "    - Appending **not** before a set's implicit definition produces the set **complement**. For example: $\\text{not } A = A^c = \\{\\text{all outcomes not in } A\\}$\n",
    "\n",
    "    - Concatenating sets with an **or** produces their **union**. For example, $S = A \\cup V$ if $V = \\{y,z\\}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "    - Concatenating sets with an **and** produces their **intersection**. For example, $B = \\{b,c,d,e\\}$ then $A \\cap B = \\{b,c\\}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "    - Modifying a probability statement with an **if** adds conditions that restrict the space of possible outcomes $\\Omega$. We denote **if** with a vertical bar **|**.\n",

    "\n",
    "These results are all explained in [Section 1.2](ch1.2).\n",
    "\n",
    "1. A **probability measure** is a function that accepts events and returns their chance. We denote the measure, $\\text{Pr}(\\cdot)$ so $\\text{Pr}(A)$ is the chance the event $A$ occurs. \n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Probability as Frequency:** The **chance** of an event equals the **long run frequency with which it would occur in an arbitrarily long sequence of trials**\n",

    "\n",
    "        - All chances are between 0 and 1\n",
    "\n",
    "        - The chance that something happens, $\\text{Pr}(\\Omega)$, equals 1\n",

    "\n",
    "        - Expanding an event to include more outcomes never makes it less likely. Contracting an event so it includes fewer outcomes never makes it more likely.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. We say that all outcomes are **equally likely** if:\n",
    "\n",
    "    - They would occur with the same long run frequency\n",
    "\n",
    "    - We have no better model and want to start simple\n",
    "\n",
    "    - The features that distinguish outcomes cannot possibly influence their frequency, or the process that selects outcomes\n",
    "\n",
    "1. If all outcomes are equally likely then **probability is equivalent to proportion:**\n",
    "\n",
    "    - The probability of every outcome is $1/|\\Omega|$ where $|\\Omega|$ is the number of possible outcomes\n",
    "\n",
    "    - The probability of every event is:\n",
    "\n",
    "    $$\\text{Pr}(E) = \\frac{|E|}{|\\Omega|} = \\frac{\\text{the number of ways } E \\text{ can happen}}{\\text{the number of distinct things that can happen}} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "    - So, if all outcomes are equally likely, we can compute probabilities by (a) enumerating the outcome space, (b) counting the number of possible outcomes, (c) enumerating the event, (d) counting the number of ways the event can happen, and (d) evaluating their ratio. \n",
