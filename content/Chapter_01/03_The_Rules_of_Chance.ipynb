    "Not all outcomes are equally likely, not all systems are symmetric or close to symmetric, and, while we can build outcome spaces without equally likely outcomes from outcome spaces with equally likely outcomes, it is rarely worthwhile to expand the natural description of outcomes into a detailed description in pursuit of equal likelihood. In many cases, the virtue of a probability model is its ability to match observed frequencies, and to derive consequences of those frequencies, without requiring a detailed explanation for the mechanism that produced them.\n",

    "What we want is a more general theory that allows any outcome space, and any assignment of chance to events, such that the assignment of chance to events could be equated to frequencies of outcomes in a string of repeated trials, or to proportions in a more detailed symmetric model. Thankfully, many models can satisfy these requirements as long as they satisfy three simple rules. These rules are the heart of probability."

    "A **probability model** is a procedure that returns an answer for any question of the kind, *\"What is the probability of the event $E$?\"* The procedure should provide an answer for any event $E$ in an outcome space. Since events are subsets of $\\Omega$, the probability model must specify a rule that accepts sets as inputs and returns chances. Since chances are meant to model proportions, or frequencies, they are real valued numbers between zero and one. The function that accepts any subset of $\\Omega$, and returns a real number representing its chance is the **probability measure**. A **measure** is any function that accepts all subsets of an outcome space $\\Omega$ and returns a real number. \n",
    "\n",
    "We've already fixed notation for the probability measure, since we defined $\\text{Pr}(E)$ to be the probability of the event $E$. Therefore, $\\text{Pr}$ is the probability measure. The probability model is the combination of the outcome space $\\Omega$, the collection of all its subsets that we might ask about as events, and the probability measure $\\text{Pr}$ that returns the chance of any event we ask about. \n",
    "\n",
    "A probability model is valid if the measure satisfies three rules. These are Kolmogorov's probability axioms. The first two are not surprising, since chances are meant to model proportions or frequencies. The last is the most substantive. We observed that it was true for proportions (see [Section 1.2](#ch1.2)).\n",

If $A$ and $B$ are disjoint, then the number of outcomes in either $A$ or $B$ equals the number of outcomes in $A$ plus the number of outcomes in $B$. If $A$ and $B$ are not disjoint, i.e. are not mutually exclusive, then they could co-occur, so they share some outcomes. In that case, the number of elements in either $A$ or $B$ is *less* than the number of elements in $A$ plus the number of elements in $B$.\n",

By assigning a chance to each outcome, then by adding chances together to find the probability of events, we saw that, if outcomes are equally likely, then the probability of an event is the fraction of all possible outcomes that satisfy the event definition. We can repeat the same process by applying the axioms to any rule that assigns a well-defined chance to every outcome.\n",
