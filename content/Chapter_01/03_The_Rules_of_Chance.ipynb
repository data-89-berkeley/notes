    "Not all outcomes are equally likely, not all systems are symmetric or close to symmetric, and, while we can build outcome spaces without equally likely outcomes from outcome spaces with equally likely outcomes, it is rarely worthwhile to expand the natural description of outcomes into a detailed description in pursuit of equal likelihood. In many cases, the virtue of a probability model is its ability to match observed frequencies, and to derive consequences of those frequencies, without requiring a detailed explanation for the mechanism that produced the observed frequencies.\n",
    "\n",
    "So, what we want instead is a more general theory that allows any outcome space, and any assignment of chance to events, so that the assignment of chance to events is self-consistent, and could be equated to frequencies of outcomes, or proportions in a more detailed symmetric model. Thankfully, many models can satisfy these requirements as long as they satisfy three simple rules. These rules are the heart of probability."

    "## The Probability Axioms\n",
    "\n",
    "A **probability model** is a procedure that returns an answer for any question of the kind, \"What is the probability of the event $E$?\" for any event $E$ in an outcome space. Since events are subsets of $\\Omega$, the probability model must specify a rule that accepts sets as inputs and returns chances. Since chances are meant to model proportions, or frequencies, they are real valued numbers between zero and one. The function that accepts any subset of $\\Omega$, and returns a real number representing its chance is the **probability measure**. A **measure** is any function that accepts all subsets of an outcome space $\\Omega$ and returns a real number. \n",
    "\n",
    "We've already fixed notation for the probability measure, since we defined $\\text{Pr}(E)$ to be the probability of the event $E$. Therefore, $\\text{Pr}$ is the probability measure. The probability model is the combination of the outcome space $\\Omega$, the collection of all its subsets that we might ask about as events, and the probability measure $\\text{Pr}$ that returns the chance of any event we ask about. \n",
    "\n",
    "A probability model is valid if the measure satisfies three rules. These are Kolmogorov's probability axioms. The first two are not surprising, since chances are meant to model proportions or frequencies. The last is the most substantive. We observed that it was true for proportions.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Nonnegativity:** $\\text{Pr}(E) \\geq 0$.\n",
    "    - The probability of any event is greater than or equal to zero. \n",
    "    - In other words, chances cannot be negative. \n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Normalization:** $\\text{Pr}(\\Omega) = 1$.\n",
    "    - One of the outcomes in $\\Omega$ must occur. \n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Additivity:** If $A$ and $B$ are disjoint events then $\\text{Pr}(A \\cup B) = \\text{Pr}(A) + \\text{Pr}(B)$\n",
    "    - The probability that either $A$ or $B$ happen, equals the probability $A$ happens plus the probability $B$ happens, if $A$ and $B$ cannot occur simultaneously.\n",
    "    - This is a sensible conclusion for proportions. If $A$ and $B$ are disjoint, then the number of outcomes in either $A$ or $B$ equals the number of outcomes in $A$ plus the number of outcomes in $B$. If $A$ and $B$ are not disjoint, i.e. ~are not mutually exclusive, then they could co-occur, so they share some outcomes. In that case, the number of elements in either $A$ or $B$ is *less* than the number of elements in $A$ plus the number of elements in $B$.\n",
    "    - So, only apply this addition rule **when the events are mutually exclusive.** We will explore the case when the events overlap in the next section."

    "\n",
    "An axiom is a mathematical statement that is asserted as a basic premise for a theory. Many rich mathematical areas are built by first posing a short list of self-evident (or, at least, plausible) axioms. Once accepted, the axioms are used to prove the rest of the theory. Let's practice this way of thinking using the probability axioms.\n",

    "\n",
    "$$\\text{Pr}(A^c) = 1 - \\text{Pr}(A) $$\n",

    "That is, the probability that an event does not occur equals one minus the probability that it does occur. \n",
    "\n",
    "This rule might appear self-evident. For instance, it may feel instinctive that, if the probability that it rains tomorrow is 1/3, then the probability is doesn't rain should be 2/3. Let's show that we don't need this rule as an additional fourth axiom. Instead, it is implied by the first three.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Proof:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The sets $A$ and $A^c$ are disjoint for any event $A$. No outcome can simultaneously satisfy the conditions needed to be in $A$ and to not be in $A$.\n",

    "1. The sets $A$ and $A^c$ partition $\\Omega$ since $A \\cup A^c = \\Omega$. \n",

Then, shade the region outside the circle. This is all outcomes not in $A$. When you've finished shading $A^c$, you will have shaded the whole box. \n",
    "\n",
    "1. So, by additivity, $\\text{Pr}(A) + \\text{Pr}(A^c) = \\text{Pr}(\\Omega)$.\n",

    "Our union rule looks different than the complement rule since it does not hold for all pairs of events. What happens if $A$ and $B$ are not disjoint?\n",
    "\n",
    "An example suffices. What is the chance that a single roll of a fair die is even *or* is less than 4. The event that the roll is even contains the outcomes $\\{2,4,6\\}$. The event that it is less than 4 contains the outcomes $\\{1,2,3\\}$. So, the event that the roll is even or less than 4 contains the outcomes $\\{1,2,3,4,6\\}$. There are five of these outcomes so the desired probability is $5/6$.\n",

    "\n",
    "In this case the sum of the individual probabilities is too large. It equals one, which is clearly wrong, since it is possible to roll a value that is neither even nor less than 4. The only such value is a 5, so $\\text{Pr}(\\text{even or less than 4}) = 1 - \\text{Pr}(\\text{odd and greater than or equal to 4}) = 1 - (1/6) = 5/6.$\n",
    "\n",
    "The sum of the individual probabilities is too large since it counts an outcome twice. The outcome where the die lands on 2 appears in both events since 2 is both even and less than 4. In fact, $\\{2\\} = \\{\\text{even and < 4}\\} = \\{2,4,6\\} \\cap \\{1,2,3\\}$. The sum of the probability that the die roll is even and the probability that the roll is less than four counts the outcomes that are even and less than four twice, once for each set. Therefore, it overcounts the intersection of the events:\n",
