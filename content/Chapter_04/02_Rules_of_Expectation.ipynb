    "# Rules of Expectation\n",
    "\n",
    "In [Section 4.1](#ch4.1) we introduced the basic definition of an expectation as a weighted average. This definition provides a direct formula for computing an expectation. Evaluate a weighted average of the possible values of the random variable, weighted by their likelihood. \n",
    "\n",
    "Evaluating these averages can be tricky. We'll spend a couple weeks practicing integrals and sums, but, it will take some work before we can confidently evaluate interesting expectations directly. \n",
    "\n",
    "Nevertheless, expectations are popular summary values because they obey a variety of useful rules. These rules make it possible to compute many expectations without ever performing summation acrobatics. Instead of plugging into the definition, we can often find an expectation by applying the rules of expectation. \n",
    "\n",
    "This section will introduce the most useful ones. We will start with an example for motivation, then will explore three sets of rules. Once we've built up a list of rules, we'll come back and complete our example without working through the sum directly. "

    "This is close to, but not quite, $n$ choose $(x - 1)$. It falls short since the terms in the denominator add to $(x - 1) + (n - x) = n - 1$ not $n$. That sais, with a little rearranging, we can relate it to $(n-1)$ choose $(x - 1)$:\n",

    "\n",
    "Take a look at the bounds of the sum again. We started from $x = 0$. But $x = 0$ will cause us headaches if we plug $0 - 1 = -1$ into a factorial. This is a clue to back up and look at the original expression. Originally, we had:\n",

Now, notice that the resulting sum is a sum over $n-1$ different terms, where each term inside the sum looks like the value of a binomial PMF on $n - 1$ trials, for $x - 1$ successes. Since binomial PMFs are a PMF, they are normalized. If we write the sum as a sum over all the values of a binomial PMF, then we will know its value must equal one!\n",

    ":::\n",
    "\n",
