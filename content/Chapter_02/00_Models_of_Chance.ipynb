    "### Where We Are\n",
    "\n",
    "Chapter 1 established the essential rules of chance. These all stem from the three axioms: nonnegativity, normalization, and additivity (see [Section 1.3](ch1.3)). The rules are essential since they:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Establish the constraints all probability models obey\n",
    "\n",
    "- Provide algebra rules that make it easier to compute chances\n",
    "\n",
    "In general, our computational strategy comes in three parts:\n",
    "\n",
    ":::{tip} Steps to Compute Chances\n",
    "1. Write down the event of interest.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. If the event is complicated, expand it is a combination of simpler events by writing it as a logical statement involving the operators *not*, *or*, *and*, and *if* ([Section 1.1](ch1.1)). \n",
    "\n",
    "1. Apply the appropriate probability rule to break the chance down into a combination of the chances of the simpler events, applying the matching algebra rules to compute, or bound, each chance. These were:\n",
    "\n",
    "    - subtract from one for *not* ([Section 1.3](ch1.3))\n",
    "\n",
    "    - add for *or* ([Section 1.3](ch1.3))\n",
    "\n",
    "    - multiply for *and* ([Sections 1.5](ch1.5) and [1.6](ch1.6))\n",
    "\n",
    "    - divide by the appropriate marginal (normalize) for *if* ([Section 1.5](ch1.5))\n",
    ":::\n",
    "\n",
    "This scheme is missing an initial step. *It does not tell us how to pick our chance model.* It only tells us which proposed models are valid. Leaving Chapter 1, our only concrete chance model is probability as proportion, which only applies if outcomes are equally likely ([Section 1.2](ch1.5)). \n",
    "\n",
    "In a sense, we've set the stage, but have not introduced the players. This chapter introduces our main characters. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Where We're Going\n",
    "\n",
    "The chapter will introduce the two basic categories of chance models we will study this semester. It will:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Define **random variables** and introduce the idea of a **distribution function** ([Section 2.1](ch2.1))\n",
    "\n",
    "    - Relate random variables to measurements associated with random outcomes.\n",
    "\n",
    "    - Show how a distribution function can represent a probability measure.\n",
    "\n",
    "    - Distinguish types of distribution functions (**cumulative** or **local**).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Introduce **discrete random variables** and their distribution function, the **probability mass function (PMF)** ([Section 2.2](ch2.2))\n",
    "\n",
    "    - Show how to derive a PMF from the description of a random process \n",
    "\n",
    "    - Introduce three key models: the **(1) Bernoulli, (2) Geometric,** and **(3) Binomial.**\n",
    "\n",
    "        - Study the shape of the associated PMF's.\n",
    "\n",
    "        - Examine how parameters specify models.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Introduce **continuous random variables** and their distribution function, the **probability density function (PDF)** ([Sections 2.3](ch2.3) and [2.4](ch2.4))\n",
    "\n",
    "    - Study the probability of exact events to distinguish *possible* and *probable*.\n",
    "\n",
    "    - Interrogate what we mean when we assume *continuity*\n",
    "\n",
    "    - Distinguish a density function (PDF) from a (PMF)\n",
    "\n",
    "    - Show how to compute chances given a PDF\n",
    "\n",
    "    - Introduce four key models: the **(1) Uniform, (2) Exponential, (3) Pareto,** and **(4) Normal.**\n",
    "\n",
    "        - Study the shape of the associated PDF's and contrast modeling by shape to modeling by story.\n",
    "\n",
    "        - Examine how parameters specify models.\n",
