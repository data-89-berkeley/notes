    "### By Experiment\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's start with an experiment. We've already seen that we can:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Define uniform continuous variables by equating chances to proportions of length or area\n",
    "1. Relate chances of events to long run frequencies\n",
    "1. Define arbitrary continuous random variables by fixing a cumulative distribution function (CDF).\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's set up an experiment that puts these ideas to work. We'll start with a uniform continuous random variable, transform it to get something non-uniform, divide up its support into small pieces, then draw many copies of the variable and see how frequently it lands in each piece. Since probabilities equal long run frequencies, the associated histogram will represent a distribution function. Formally, its a categorical distribution with categories equal to the histogram bins. The key continuous idea is, *we have the freedom to change the width of the bins*.\n",
    "\n",
    "To get a detailed picture of the distribution, we'll try to take a limit where the bins get arbitrarily small. Per [Section 2.3](ch2.3), we'll see that, making the bins narrower, lowers the frequency that outcomes land in each bin, so to keep the histogram bars about the same height as we narrow the bins we'll have to scale by the width of the bins. Scaling by width produces a density. Once we've seen a density, we'll show that, unlike the PMF, the density function can be used to recover a CDF. Then, since a CDF specifies a measure, the density function is enough to define a probability model. \n",
    "\n",
    "Imagine you are throwing darts at a dartboard. We'll imagine that you're not very good at darts, so the position of each dart is uniform over the board. For a circular board this means we are picking a location uniformly from the interior of a circle. \n",
    "\n",
    "This is a uniform continuous model, so we can measure chances. The chance a dart lands in some region $A$ on the board, is:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\text{Pr}(\\text{dart lands in } A) = \\frac{\\text{area of } A}{\\text{area of dart board}} = \\frac{|A|}{|\\Omega|} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $\\Omega$ is the collection of all possible positions the dart could land (the circular board). \n",
    "\n",
    "You want your darts to land near the center of the board. So, you decide to measure the distance the dart lands from the center. The dart's position is random, so is it's distance from the middle of the board. We'll call that random variable $R$ for radius. \n",
    "\n",
    "$R$ is a continuous random variable. For simplicity, let's assume the dart board has radius 1. Then, $R$ is supported on the interval $[0,1]$ since we, at best, hit the center of the board, and, at worst, hit the outer edge. \n",
    "\n",
    "Is $R$ uniformly distributed? Take a moment to think about this carefully before answering. \n",
    "\n",
    "If you're unsure how to proceed, remember that its often easier to start with a CDF. What is:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\text{CDF}(r) = \\text{Pr}(R \\leq r)? $$\n",
    "\n",
    "Well, the region on the board where $R \\leq r$ is the interior of a circle centered at zero, with radius $0 \\leq r \\leq 1$. We don't have to worry about the distinction between $\\leq r$ and $< r$ since the position of the dart is continuous. We can now visualize the event $R \\leq r$ as a filled circle with radius $r$ inside a larger circle of radius 1. The chance we land in the inner circle is the ratio of its area to the area of the full circle.\n",
    "\n",
    "So, using probability by proportion:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\text{CDF}(r) = \\text{Pr}(R \\leq r) = \\frac{\\pi r^2}{\\pi 1^2} = r^2. $$\n",
    "\n",
    "To check whether this CDF could correspond to a uniform measure, let's compare the chances that $R$ lands in two intervals of equal length. For instance, what are the odds that $R > 1/2$ compared to the odds $R \\leq 1/2$?\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\begin{aligned}\\frac{\\text{Pr}(R > 0.5)}{\\text{Pr}(R \\leq 0.5)} = \\frac{1 - \\text{Pr}(R \\leq 0.5)}{\\text{Pr}(R \\leq 0.5)} \\\\& = \\frac{1 - \\text{CDF}(0.5)}{\\text{CDF}(0.5)} \\\\& = \\frac{1 - 0.5^2}{0.5^2} \\\\& = 4 \\times \\frac{3}{4} \\\\& = 3 \\end{aligned}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "So, the dart is *3 times more likely* to land in the outer interval, $(1/2,1]$ than the inner interval, $[0,1/2]$. So, the dart's distance from the origin cannot be uniformly distributed. It is more likely to land farther from the center of the board than closer to the center. \n",

    "To visualize this bias, let's run the following experiment:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Throw a bunch of darts (sample uniformly from the circle), \n",

Then, there is usually a relatively simple function of $x$ and the parameters that determines the shape of the distribution.
