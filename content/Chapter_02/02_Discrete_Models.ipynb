For instance, if I am interested in whether a string of coin tosses contains at least 5 heads, I could define an event $E$, which contains all strings with at least five heads and set $X$ to an indicator for the event. Then, when the event occurs (a success), my indicator equals 1. So, the chance of success is $\\text{Pr}(X = 1)$.\n",

The most recent trial was always either a success or a failure, so if you are currently at $s$ successes, then in the previous round you were either at $s - 1$ or $s$ successes. In either case, the number of ways you could get to $s$ successes in $n$ rounds is the number of ways you could get to $s - 1$ in $n - 1$ plus the number of ways you could get to $s$ in $n - 1$.

We've asked for the chance that, if we tossed a fair die, we would see an event equally, or more suspicious, than the event we did observe, and we've been careful not to over-specify our event. By defining the event as generically as possible, we've made ensured that there are modifications of the event statement that could occur often. For example, the chance a fair die lands on the same side 2 or more times in ten tosses is quite large. It is the disparity in these chances that will allow us to build statistical evidence that my die was biased.\n",

    "1. We could see exactly 9 matched tosses, or exactly 10 matched tosses. Let's call the number of matched tosses $X$. Then we can write the probability of 9 matched tosses as the chance $X = 9$, and the probability of 10 matched tosses $X = 10$. These events are mutually exclusive, so their chances add. \n",
    "\n",
    "1. We could see matches on any of the six sides. We weren't really suspicious because it was the side labelled \"4\" that occured so frequently. We would have been equally suspicious had it been side \"1\" or side \"6\". So, we can partition again by the side label that re-occurs. There are 6 options for the re-occuring side, and the events that the side \"4\" occurs $x > 5$ times and the side \"2\" occurs $x > 5$ are mutually exclusive. So, their probabilities add. Since all 6 are symmetric when the die is fair (we could relabel all the sides and would have no way to tell), adding their chances is the same as computing the chance for a specific side, then multiplying by 6.\n",
    "\n",
    "So, let $X$ denote the number of times the side \"4\" appears in 10 tosses. Then the chance we are looking for is:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\begin{aligned} 6 \\times \\text{Pr}(X = 9) + 6 \\times \\text{Pr}(X = 10) = 6 \\times (\\text{Pr}(X = 9) + \\text{Pr}(X = 10)) = 6 \\times (\\text{PMF}(9) + \\text{PMF}(10)). \\end{aligned}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "To fill in the PMF's, we need to recognize $X$ as a familiar random variable. The random variable $X$ is the number of times a die lands on the side \"4\" in 10 identical, independent tosses. If we call each toss an experiment, or trial, and consider each trial a success if we see a \"4\", then $X$ is the number of successes in a sequence of 10 identical, independent binary trials. The success outcome is \"rolled a 4.\" The failure outcome is \"did not roll a 4.\"\n",

    "### Some General Lessons\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are some last thoughts:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. It's worth remembering that there are two ways of defining a random variable, and associated distribution. \n",
    "    - The implicit approach is the most natural from an applied perspective. We're interested in some random process in the world, have a natural language description of the process, and want to derive, from that description, the chances of events. Most of the important discrete distributions are tied to a particular story (natural language description of process), family of related stories. This approach is less common for distributions associated with continuous variables. \n",
    "    - All distributions can also be defined explicitly. Just like we can define a set in natural language (implicitly), then convert to an explicit list of elements, we can also define a distribution explicitly, by listing all the possible values of the random variable, then writing down a function that computes the chance of each event. Usually these functions have free parameters that are:\n",
    "        - allowed to vary so that the modeler has the freedom to express many different distributions with a single function, and\n",
    "        - allowed to vary to represent natural variants in the story associated with the distribution. For example, the parameters $n$ and $p$ of the Binomial distribution are naturally associated with a number of trials, and a chance of success per trial.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. So, one skill you should develop is the ability to go back and forth between a functional form, with free parameters, and the shape of a distribution. It is very important that you understand how a distribution changes when we change its parameters. Understanding the parameteric dependence of chance means that you understand how the free elements of a question (e.g. the number of trials), influence the answer to your question. We'll practice this skill explicitly in the next chapter. The better you get at it, the faster you'll be able to make sense of equations, see how your answers depend on the set up to a question, gut check whether your answers are sensible, and, if asked to develop a new model, to choose a family of functions.
