For instance, if I am interested in whether a string of coin tosses contains at least 5 heads, I could define an event $E$, which contains all strings with at least five heads and set $X$ to an indicator for the event. Then, when the event occurs (a success), my indicator equals 1. So, the chance of success is $\\text{Pr}(X = 1)$.\n",

    "### Some General Lessons\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are some last thoughts:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. It's worth remembering that there are two ways of defining a random variable, and associated distribution. \n",
    "    - The implicit approach is the most natural from an applied perspective. We're interested in some random process in the world, have a natural language description of the process, and want to derive, from that description, the chances of events. Most of the important discrete distributions are tied to a particular story (natural language description of process), family of related stories. This approach is less common for distributions associated with continuous variables. \n",
    "    - All distributions can also be defined explicitly. Just like we can define a set in natural language (implicitly), then convert to an explicit list of elements, we can also define a distribution explicitly, by listing all the possible values of the random variable, then writing down a function that computes the chance of each event. Usually these functions have free parameters that are:\n",
    "        - allowed to vary so that the modeler has the freedom to express many different distributions with a single function, and\n",
    "        - allowed to vary to represent natural variants in the story associated with the distribution. For example, the parameters $n$ and $p$ of the Binomial distribution are naturally associated with a number of trials, and a chance of success per trial.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. So, one skill you should develop is the ability to go back and forth between a functional form, with free parameters, and the shape of a distribution. It is very important that you understand how a distribution changes when we change its parameters. Understanding the parameteric dependence of chance means that you understand how the free elements of a question (e.g. the number of trials), influence the answer to your question. We'll practice this skill explicitly in the next chapter. The better you get at it, the faster you'll be able to make sense of equations, see how your answers depend on the set up to a question, gut check whether your answers are sensible, and, if asked to develop a new model, to choose a family of functions.
